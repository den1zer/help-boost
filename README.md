# help-boost
Help&amp;Boost is a web-based application designed to gamify humanitarian aid. The platform allows users to log their contributions (donations, volunteering), earning points, levels, and badges. Their activity is displayed on a dynamic dashboard and leaderboards, motivating them to continue their support and track the overall impact.
